# Ufo Sightings

## Overview of Project

The purpose of the project is to create a web app where users interested in UFO sightings can readily search for information using search criteria such as location, dates and shapes.
The search functionality is powered by Javascript and D3. 


## Results

Users are able to generate a variety of results and also perform some research using the search filters. Results can be generated by providing values to the input boxes of one or more filters and then pressing the keyboard enter key. See examples below.

* Results with filters - State

* Results with filters - State and Shape

* Results with filters - City

* Results with filters - City and Date

## Summary

* One of the drawbacks in the current app is that it currently uses a json file for data. That'll prove inflexible in the future if users wanted to report UFO sightings on the app which could have then be further added to the search database.

* The input boxes for filters are limited in functionality, for instance, the values must match the letter case in the database, there is no error message reported if a search criteria is not met, and autofill capabilities are missing as well. These features could be added to the further development of the input boxes.

* Another marked improvement would be to add accessibilty features to the app to make it AODA compliant and also enjoyable for people will different abilities.
